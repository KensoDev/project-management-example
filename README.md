# Sample SAAS project management system

I am creating this project as part of a free screencast series I am doing (in Hebrew).

The purpose of the project and the screencasts is to show the users, how they can create a SAAS project from scratch using Ruby/Rails as the main tool.

The project is done completely play by play during the screencasts, there's no work done in the background or off screen.

You can find all of the screencasts in my Hebrew blog here: http://he.kensodev.com.
